      <title> üìö Me Before You </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;üìöFinished reading: Me Before Youüìö Consindering I&amp;rsquo;m new to English fiction, I figure I should pick popuar ones for starters. And to be honest? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Me-Before-You-Novel-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B0089EHWQE/&#34;&gt;I LOVE romance fictions üòÇ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I know it up-front that this story is meant to be a sad one. Yet every now and then, when the book talked about how to see the world, to try all the possibilities, and to have someone company have helped other quadriplegic people survived, I was hoping Will would, somehow, make it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will was insecure. He said nobody could predict what‚Äôs in the future and Lou may not love him at all. I think this exact idea also haunted him, that if Lou has made him alive, he would be devastated when she wouldn‚Äôt love him anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will said to Lou that she was not enough for him. He absolutely (well, at least for me) loved her. Not true. He freed her, and he thought she would never be truly free if she was around him. He was such a free spirit that (I assume) he couldn‚Äôt even bear the idea that he would tied her foot down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping, especially when I was approaching the end, that Lou could lead him back. Just as Will‚Äôs mother, she held on tot a tiny little hope until the very end, in that vey normal room in Switzerland. But Will was so determined, it is what makes of him. Otherwise he won‚Äôt become the person he used to be anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was hoping, that he could be more selfish, enough so that he can keep Lou around him; that he didn‚Äôt feel the responsibility to free anyone else. But there he was. Non-Stoppable soul. We knew it up front, that he wasn‚Äôt just this type of person.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think of this micro.blog as a personal space for posting quick (and weird) ideas ‚ú®, photos taken by cellphones üì∏, and probably short book reviews üìö. In a way I like those social-network-style entries, and I want to be able to continue post them even if I decided to go &lt;strong&gt;social-media free&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s the biggest motivation for creating this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a &lt;strong&gt;mini version&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ying-ish.com/&#34;&gt;my site, of myself&lt;/a&gt;. And this is why this site has the subdomain &lt;a href=&#34;https://mini.ying-ish.com/&#34;&gt;mini.ying-ish.com&lt;/a&gt; üê£&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done importing some photos originally posted on WeChat into the new gallery page on my microblog site. I usually don&amp;rsquo;t have the camera with me (it&amp;rsquo;s too heavy!) and take photos by phone. My cellphone is about to retire and the image quality isn&amp;rsquo;t always good (at least not enough for a high-resolution desktop browser). There are some photos took by my cellphone that I really like, I will organize them into this gallery üåá.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so into the idea of a clean, ads-free, and self-hosted ‚Äútwitter-style‚Äù account. And the best part, I have total control over the contents. I post them but not for ‚Äúlikes‚Äù üòé It will be more for myself than for something else.&lt;/p&gt;
