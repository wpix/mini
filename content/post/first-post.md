 ðŸ“šFinished reading: Me Before YouðŸ“š Consindering I'm new to English fiction, I figure I should pick popuar ones for starters. And to be honest? [I LOVE romance fictions ðŸ˜‚](https://www.amazon.com/Me-Before-You-Novel-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B0089EHWQE/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=me+before+you&qid=1557036154&s=gateway&sr=8-3)

 I guess, that I know it up-front that this story is meant to be a sad one. Yet every now and then, when the book talked about how to see the world, to try all the possibilities, and to have someone company have helped other quadriplegic people survived, I was hoping Will would, somehow, make it as well.  

I noticed that I kind of refusing to accept it. Later when I lied on my bed, my thoughts were still racing and I suddenly understood it was not true: Will saying to Lou that she was not enough for him. He absolutely (well, at least for me) loved her. He freed her, and he knew she would never be truly free if she was around him. He was such a free spirit that (I assume) he couldnâ€™t even be able to bear the idea that he would tied her down.  

I do think Will is selfish. Yet I couldnâ€™t blame him even the slightest for being selfish after all he had been through. I think he was also scared, and insecure. He said nobody could predict whatâ€™s in the future and Lou may not love him at all. I think this exact idea also haunted him, that if Lou has made him alive, he would be devastated when she wouldnâ€™t love him anymore.

I was hoping, especially when I was approaching the end, that Lou could lead him back. Just as Willâ€™s mother, she held on tot a tiny little hope until the very end, in that vey normal room in Switzerland. But we knew, he was so determined, it is what makes of him. Otherwise he wonâ€™t become the person he used to be anyway.
I was hoping, that when Lou showed him her scars inside her body, he would somehow see the meaning of continuing his own life as he is the only one we ever changed Lou in a good way, touched her heart where nobody had ever been.  

I was hoping, that he should be more selfish, enough so that he can keep Lou around him; that he didnâ€™t feel the responsibility to free anyone else; that he didnâ€™t care the old him.

But there he was. Non-Stoppable soul. We knew it up front, that he wasnâ€™t just this type of person.
