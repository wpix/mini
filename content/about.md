I'd like to think of this micro.blog as a personal space for posting quick (and weird) ideas, photos taken by cellphones, and probably short book reviews. Like a **mini version** of [of myself](https://www.ying-ish.com/).

I've done importing some photos originally posted on WeChat into the new gallery page. I usually don't have the camera with me (it's too heavy!) and take photos by phone. My cell is about to retire and the image quality isn't always good (at least not enough for a high-resolution desktop browser). But I do love some of those photos and would like to share them here. 

Everything on this site will be more for myself than for anyone else.
